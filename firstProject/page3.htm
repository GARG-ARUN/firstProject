<h2 class="ui">Hockey and its Origins</h2>
<p class="ui">
The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity. Historical records show that a crude form of the game
was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in Ethiopia around 1,000BC,<br> whilst an ancient form of the game 
was also played in Iran in around 2,000BC. <br>
Various museums offer evidence that a form of the game was played by the Romans and Greeks as well as by
the Aztecs several centuries before Columbus arrived in the New World.<br>
The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century and is largely attributed to the 
growth of public schools, such as Eton.<br>
The first Hockey Association was formed in the UK in 1876 and drew up the first formal set of rules.
The original association survived for just six years but, in 1886, it was revived by nine founding 
member clubs.

1920 in Antwerp after pressure from Belgian hockey advocates before being omitted again in Paris in 1924.<br>
The formation of the International Hockey Federation in 1924 was not soon enough for the Paris
Olympics but it did grant hockey re-entry in Amsterdam in 1928. Hockey has been on the programme
ever since, with women's hockey included for the first time in Moscow in
