<h1 class="cd">About Hockey</h1><br>
Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family. The game can be played on grass,
 watered turf, artificial turf or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. Each team
 plays with ten field players and a goalkeeper. Players commonly use sticks made out of wood, carbon
 fibre, fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities 
(with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round,
 hard, plastic hockey ball. The length of the hockey stick is based on the player's individual height:
 the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip, and taller players typically have taller sticks.
[1] The sticks have a round side and a flat side only the flat face of the stick is allowed to be used;
 if the other side is used it results in a foul. Goalies often have a different kind of stick; however, 
they can also use an ordinary field hockey stick. <br><br>
A popular variant of field hockey is indoor field hockey, which differs in a number of respects while
 embodying the primary principles of hockey. Indoor hockey is a 5-a-side variant, with a field which 
is reduced to approximately 40 m × 20 m (131 ft × 66 ft). With many of the rules remaining the same, 
including obstruction and feet, there are several key variations: Players may not raise the ball unless
 shooting on goal, players may not hit the ball (instead using pushes to transfer the ball), and the
 sidelines are replaced with solid barriers which the ball will rebound off.[5] In addition, the 
regulation guidelines for the indoor field hockey stick require a slightly thinner, lighter stick than
 an outdoor stick.
